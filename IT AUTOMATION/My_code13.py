Accessing characters in Python
In Python, individual characters of a String can be accessed by using the method of Indexing. 
Indexing allows negative address references to access characters from the back of the String,
e.g. -1 refers to the last character, -2 refers to the second last character, and so on. 
'''
'''
string1 = "Man who Eats Time"
print("Initial string is : ")
print(string1)
print("first index is :")
print(string1[0])
'''
'''
String Slicing
To access a range of characters in the String, the method of slicing is used. 
Slicing in a String is done by using a Slicing operator (colon). 
'''
string1 = "My Dog having black spots"
print(string1)
print("slicing")
print(string1[2:6])
print(string1[-4])
print(string1[-4:3])
